This repository contains my completed capstone project for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate on Coursera, focusing on SpaceX launch data analysis and prediction.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to analyze SpaceX launch data and build predictive models to determine the success probability of Falcon 9 first stage landings. The project covers the full data science lifecycle from data collection to deployment.

## Key Components

### 1. Data Collection
- Web scraping SpaceX launch data from Wikipedia
- Using the SpaceX REST API to gather additional launch details

### 2. Data Wrangling
- Cleaning and transforming raw data
- Feature engineering (e.g., calculating payload mass to orbit)
- Handling missing values and outliers

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualizing launch trends over time
- Analyzing success rates by launch site, payload mass, and other factors
- Identifying key predictors of successful landings

### 4. Predictive Modeling
- Comparing different classification algorithms:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machines
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
- Hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation

### 5. Dashboard Development
- Interactive dashboard using Plotly Dash
- Visualizations of launch statistics and predictions
